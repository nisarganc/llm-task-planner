# Robot 1 has 13 skills. 
# All the robots share the same set and number of skills (no_skills) & all objects DONOT have same mass. In this case where all robots have same skills and all objects have different mass- Focus on Task Allocation based on Mass alone. 
# Analyze the mass required for each object being PickedUp by the 'PickupObject' skill, and the mass capacity each robot possesses. In this scenario, we have one main subtask: 'Switch off the lights'.
# For the 'Switch off the lights' subtask, it can be performed by any robot with 'GoToObject', and 'SwitchOff' skills. In this case, Robot 1 has all these skills.
# No teams are required since SubTasks can be performed with individual robots as explained above. The 'Switch off the lights' subtask is assigned to Robot 1.
