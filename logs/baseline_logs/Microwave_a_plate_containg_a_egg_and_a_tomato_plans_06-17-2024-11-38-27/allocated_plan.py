# Robot 1, 2 and 3 have different skills. All robots do not have same number of skills.
# All the robots DONOT share the same set and number of skills (no_skills) & all objects DONOT have same mass. In this case where all robots have different sets of skills and all objects have different mass - Focus on Task Allocation based on Robot Skills alone. 
# Analyze the skills required for each subtask and the skills each robot possesses. In this scenario, we have two main subtasks: 'Prepare the Plate with Egg and Tomato' and 'Microwave the Plate'.
# For the 'Prepare the Plate with Egg and Tomato' subtask, it can be performed by any robot with 'GoToObject', 'PickupObject', and 'PutObject' skills. In this case, Robots 3 has all these skills.
# For the 'Microwave the Plate' subtask, it can be performed by any robot with 'GoToObject', 'PickupObject', 'PutObject', OpenObject', CloseObject', SwitchOn' and SwitchOff' skills. However, no individual robot has all these skills. This is a skill gap that needs to be addressed. Form a team of robots. The combined skill set of Robots 1, 2 & 3 will meet all requirements for this task.
# Teams are required since SubTasks can't be performed with individual robots as explained above. The 'Prepare the Plate with Egg and Tomato' subtask is assigned to Robots 3 while team consisting of Robots 1,2 & 3 will perform "Microwave plate" task sequentially after completion of first task by Robot 3.
