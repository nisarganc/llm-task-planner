step2 is dependent on step1
step3 is dependent on step2
step4 is dependent on step3
step5 is dependent on step4
step6 is dependent on step5
step7 is dependent on step6
step8 is dependent on step7
step9 is dependent on step8
step10 is dependent on step9
step11 is dependent on step10
step12 is dependent on step11
step13 is dependent on step12

Order of execution rules: Based on the action dependencies and the number of robots available. 
1. robot0 start step1
2. robot0 wait to finish step1 and then start step2
3. robot0 wait to finish step2 and then start step3
4. robot0 wait to finish step3 and then start step4
5. robot0 wait to finish step4 and then start step5
6. robot0 wait to finish step5 and then start step6
7. robot0 wait to finish step6 and then start step7
8. robot0 wait to finish step7 and then start step8
9. robot0 wait to finish step8 and then start step9
10. robot0 wait to finish step9 and then start step10
11. robot0 wait to finish step10 and then start step11
12. robot0 wait to finish step11 and then start step12
13. robot0 wait to finish step12 and then start step13
